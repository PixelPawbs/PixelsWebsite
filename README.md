# Pixel's Website
This is Pixel's repository where all the stuff I code for my website will go!

## The Site
My website is hosted on Neocities under [pixelpawbs.com](https://pixelpawbs.com/)

The page right now is simply a static HTML web page that's full of information about my fursona 'Pixel', who is based mostly on me.

A very important thing to note is that everything is written completely *in character*.
