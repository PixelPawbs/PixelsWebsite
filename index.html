    <h2 id="intro">An Introduction to PixelPawbs</h2>
  </section>
  
  <p>If you've ever asked yourself <i>"Who is Pixel?"</i>, <i>"What is Pixel?"</i>, <i>"Why is Pixel?'</i>, <b>seek help.</b> And you've come to the right place!! This page is a just a simple introduction to all things me~!</p>
  
  <p>This is just a silly little personal website about Pixel, a furry hobbyist web developer sharing fun, creative personality-driven content.</p>
  
  <section>
  <h2 id="what">What is Pixel?</h2>
  </section>
  
  <p>Pixel is my fursona! He is basically just me, but as a cute fluffy pink kitty!! If you'd like to know more about his looks, keep reading! He isn't self aware! So keep in mind that everything else on this page is <b>IN CHARACTER</b>, as if he wrote it! (I did, he didn't write anything.... Lazy...)</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="who">Who is Pixel?</h2>
  </section>
  
  <p>I just realised... Google Pixel... Whatever. (I'm not related to the phone! 3:&#60;)</p>
  
  <p>I am simply a silly pink kitty. I love to code, I coded this very website all by myself! And I'm just an overall <i>chill guy</i>. I don't play many games, not often either. I'm not really a fan of playing games. I never really like games anyway.</p>
  
  <p>I absolutely <i>love</i> anything by <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://yonkagor.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YonKaGor</a><span class="tooltiptext">https://yonkagor.bandcamp.com/</span></span>! I <b>REFUSE</b> to listen to anything made by anyone else. Please check out their stuff when you have the time! They're just awesome :3</p>

  <p>I absoultely LOVE milk soo much~! My absolute favourite drink of all time no doubt. Tuna pasta is probably my favourite food too, it's delicious &#60;3</p>
  
  <section>
    <h2 id="looks">What Does Pixel Look Like?</h2>
  <section>
  
  <p>Sadly, I don't have a camera to take selfies, nor is there any art of me... However! I can describe myself!</p>
  
  <p>I am a tall, anthropomorphic cat! I have fluffy pastel pink fur with white highlights on my paws, belly and the tip of my tail and ears. My ears are real big and rounded, despite that, my hearing is pretty bad. I have a big fluffy canine tail, while the rest of me is feline (Don't ask how that happened.). My eyes are teal. I don't wear clothes often, my fur um... covers... everything... yea... I do love wearing socks though! They feel so comfy on my paws!</p>
